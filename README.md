# Visualisation of multithreaded CI process
## The goal
This university project focuses on visualisation of CI-like process using multithreading programming in C (ncurses) and C++.

## Most important aspects
The main requirement was to create a project that will make use of mutliple threads and solve two most common concurrency problems:
* deadlock
* starvation

Optional requirement was to (properly) use *std::contitional_variable* from C++ standard library for threads synchronization.
